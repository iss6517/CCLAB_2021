  <p>Maghrebi mint tea , also known as Moroccan mint tea, is a green<br>
     tea prepared with spearmint leaves and sugar. Mint tea is central <br>
     to social life in the Maghreb. The serving can take a ceremonial <br>
     form, especially when prepared <br>
    for a guest. The tea is traditionally made by the head male in the <br>
    family and offered to guests as a sign of hospitality. Typically, <br>
    at least three glasses of tea are served. The tea is consumed <br>
    throughout the day as a social activity. The basic ingredients  <br>
    of the tea are green tea, fresh mint leaves, sugar, and boiling  <br>
  water.The proportions of the ingredients and the brewing time  <br>
     can vary widely. Boiling water is used in the Maghreb, rather <br>
     than the cooler water that is used in East Asia to avoid bitterness.<br>
     The leaves are left in the pot while the tea is consumed, changing <br>
    the flavor from one glass to the next. It is poured into glasses <br>
     from high above to swirl loose tea leaves to the bottom of the <br>
    glass, whilst gently aerating the tea to improve its flavor.
