  <p>Maghrebi mint tea , also known as Moroccan mint tea, is a green<br>
     tea prepared with spearmint leaves and sugar. Mint tea is central <br>
     to social life in the Maghreb. The serving can take a ceremonial <br>
     form, especially when prepared for a guest. The tea is <br>
     traditionally made by the head male in the family and <br>
     offered to guests as a sign of hospitality. Typically, at least three <br>
     glasses of tea are served. The tea is consumed throughout the <br>
     day as a social activity. The basic ingredients of the tea are green <br>
     tea, fresh mint leaves, sugar, and boiling water. The proportions   <br>
     of the ingredients and the brewing time can vary widely.   <br>
     Boiling water is used in the Maghreb, rather than the cooler   <br>
     water that is used in East Asia to avoid bitterness. The leaves are  <br> left in the pot while the tea is consumed, changing the flavor from   <br>
     one glass to the next. It is poured into glasses from high above to   <br>
     swirl loose tea leaves to the bottom of the glass, whilst gently   <br>
     aerating the tea to improve its flavor.
