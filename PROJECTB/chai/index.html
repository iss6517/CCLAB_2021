  <p>Masala chai is a tea beverage made by boiling black<br>
    tea in milk and water with a mixture of aromatic<br>
    herbs and spices. Originating in South Asia, <br>
    the beverage has gained worldwide popularity, <br>
    becoming a feature in many coffee and tea houses. <br>
    Although traditionally prepared with a spice blend <br>
    of green cardamom pods, cinnamon sticks, ground <br>
    cloves, ground ginger, and black peppercorn <br>
    together with black tea leaves, the spice blend <br>
    can vary from region to region. <br>
