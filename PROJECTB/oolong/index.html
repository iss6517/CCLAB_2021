  <p>Oolong is a traditional semi-oxidized Chinese tea  produced through a process including withering the plant under strong sun and oxidation before curling and twisting. Oolong is especially popular in south China and among Chinese people in Southeast Asia, as is the Fujian preparation process known as the Gongfu tea ceremony. <br>
  Different styles of oolong tea can vary widely in flavor. They can be sweet and fruity with honey aromas, or woody and thick with roasted aromas, or green and fresh with complex aromas, all depending on the style of production. Several types of oolong tea, including those produced in the Wuyi Mountains of northern Fujian, such as Da Hong Pao, are among the most famous Chinese teas. Different varieties of oolong are processed differently, but the leaves are usually  formed into one of two distinct styles. Some are rolled into long curly leaves, while others are 'wrap-curled' into small beads, each with a tail. The former style is the more traditional.
