  <p>Oolong is a traditional semi-oxidized Chinese tea  produced through a process<br>
    including withering the plant under strong sun and oxidation before curling and <br>
    twisting. Oolong is especially popular in south China and among Chinese people <br>
    in Southeast Asia, as is the Fujian preparation process known as the Gongfu <br> tea ceremony.</p>
  </p>Different styles of oolong tea can vary widely in flavor. They can be sweet and <br>
    fruity with honey aromas, or woody and thick with roasted aromas, or green and <br>
    fresh with complex aromas, all depending on the style of production. Several <br>
    types of oolong tea, including those produced in the Wuyi Mountains of <br>
    northern Fujian, such as Da Hong Pao, are among the most famous Chinese teas. <br>
    Different varieties of oolong are processed differently, but the leaves are usually  <br>
    formed into one of two distinct styles. Some are rolled into long curly leaves, <br>
    while others are 'wrap-curled' into small beads, each with a tail. The former style <br>
    is the more traditional.
