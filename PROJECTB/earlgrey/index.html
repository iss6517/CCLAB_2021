  <p>Earl Grey tea is a tea blend which has been flavoured with oil of<br>
  bergamot. The rind's fragrant oil is added to black tea to give  <br>
  Earl Grey its unique taste. Traditionally, Earl Grey was made  <br>
  from black teas such as Chinese keemun, and therefore intended   <br>
  to be drunk without milk. However, tea companies have since <br>
  begun to offer Earl Grey made from stronger teas such as <br>
  Ceylons, which are better suited to the addition of milk or <br>
  cream. Bergamot, the main component of earl grey tea has <br>
  natural aromatherapy properties to ease stress and calm the <br>
  brain.
