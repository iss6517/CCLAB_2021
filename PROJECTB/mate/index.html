  <p>Mate is a traditional South American caffeine-rich <br>
     infused drink. It is made by soaking dried leaves <br>
     of holly in hot water and is served with a metal <br>
     straw in a container typically made from a calabash <br>
     gourd, but also in some areas made from a cattle <br>
     horn. Yerba mate contains the stimulant caffeine. <br>
     The leaves are dried and chopped or ground to make <br>
     the coarse powdery preparation called yerba <br>
     (meaning 'herb'), which is then soaked in hot water.
