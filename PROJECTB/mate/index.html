  <p>Mate is a traditional South American caffeine-rich infused drink. It is made by soaking dried leaves of holly in hot water and is served with a metal straw in a container typically made from a calabash gourd, but also in some areas made from a cattle horn. Yerba mate contains the stimulant caffeine. The leaves are dried and chopped or ground to make the coarse powdery preparation called yerba (meaning 'herb'), which is then soaked in hot water.
